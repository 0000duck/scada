    <p>This article describes how to configure communication with devices using Modbus protocol. Simple and robust, Modbus has since become a de facto standard communication protocol, and it is now a commonly available means of connecting industrial electronic devices (see Wikipedia). Rapid SCADA supports Modbus RTU, ASCII and TCP modes.</p>
    <p>The general sequence of configuring:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create an object, a communication line and devices in the configuration database using SCADA-Administrator.</li>
        <li>Configure communication between SCADA-Communicator and the devices.</li>
        <li>Create input channels in the configuration database according to the tags of the devices. Create output channels according to the commands.</li>
        <li>Create views to display data in SCADA-Web. Specify the views using SCADA-Web Configurator.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The following is a step by step guide to setup a new Modbus device. To ensure that the process of adding the device completely coincides with the text of the article, you have to install Rapid SCADA with the default configuration.</p>

    <h2>Preliminary Database Configuration</h2>
    <p>Editing the configuration database is performed using SCADA-Administrator.</p>
    <p>Run SCADA-Administrator. Open <em>Objects</em> table and add a new line for the object 2 “Test object” (see Figure 1). Then open <em>Communication lines</em> table and add the line 4 “Test line” (see Figure 2). After that open <em>Devices</em> table and add the device 41 “Test device” (see Figure 3).</p>
    <p>
        Fill the following fields for the device (see Figure 3):
    </p>
    <table class="sd-article-table">
        <tr>
            <td>Device type:</td>
            <td> Modbus</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Address:</td>
            <td>Modbus address of your device, for example, 1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Call number:</td>
            <td>IP address, if the device is connected via Ethernet</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Communication line:</td>
            <td>"Test line", which was recently created</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
